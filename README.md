submission.ipynb contains the main functionality of the code submission

The quantum tsp code is run first, then brute force, followed by nearest neighbor, simulated annealing and simulated annealing with nearest neighbor as intial solution.

The notebook shows plots of the tsp solutions along the way.

If an error is thrown for the quantum solution due to too many job calls on the IBM quantum computer, it is to be expected.
Keep running the following functions in the notebook and the notebook will progress smoothly, with no more errors.
